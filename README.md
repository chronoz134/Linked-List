# Linked-List
This is an implementation of a Dynamic Linked List

This project happened to be my most favorite one from my data structures class.
This was an implementation of a dynamic linked list with functions to add, delete, modify, display, and to purge the list.

This was one that pushed my knowledge to go into the realm of pointers and memory allocation and keeping a running idea of where the list is at all times.
